		<h2 class="keditable">Trade-Based Money Laundering Awareness &amp; Prevention.</h2>
		<div class="keditable">The nature and complexity of International Trade Finance make it an attractive medium for
criminals. Since it is considered a relatively easy way to obscure the illegal movement of
funds or transfer substantial value across borders, from a financial crime perspective, it is a
high-risk activity. Regulators therefore expect firms that provide International Trade Finance
services &amp; products to implement adequate system and controls to effectively mitigate the
compliance risk associated with Trade Finance.</div>
