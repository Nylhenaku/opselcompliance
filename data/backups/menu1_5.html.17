<div class="col-sm-4"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><a href="1_6_understanding-complete-regulatory....html"><img class="kimgfilter3" src="data/files/understandingthe.png"></a></span>
<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">In the wake of the 2007-8 financial crises properly referred to as credit crunch that destabilised the global financial markets, various regulatory bodies across the world responded by tightening regulatory measures to reduce the chance and costs of future systemic financial crises.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><a href="1_7_aml-ctf-awareness-prevention.html"><img class="kimgfilter3" src="data/files/amlandctf.png"></a></span>
<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The ongoing fight against AML/CTF is a challenging area for firms under AML/CTF laws and regulations. Weak AML/CTF controls will open up new vulnerabilities while strong and effective AML/CTF controls will make your firm a difficult target for criminals.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><a href="1_8_trade-based-money-laundering....html"><img class="kimgfilter3" src="data/files/tradebased.png"></a></span>
<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The nature and complexity of International Trade Finance make it an attractive medium for criminals. Since it is considered a relatively easy way to obscure the illegal movement of funds or transfer substantial value across borders, from a financial crime perspective, it is a high-risk activity. Regulators therefore expect firms that provide International Trade Finance services &amp; products to implement adequate systems and controls to effectively mitigate the compliance risk associated with Trade Finance.</span></div>

<div class="col-sm-4"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><a href="1_9_fraud-detection-prevention-report....html"><img class="kimgfilter3" src="data/files/Courses/Fraud Detection, Prevention and Reporting.png"></a></span>
<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Fraud poses a major threat to the banking and finance industry. It can have a devastating impact on victims and a firm’s profitability. Firms have been taking steps to protect themselves against fraud losses and offer protection for consumers. However, the question is, how effective are these steps in the prevailing changing payments landscape and internet banking?</span></div>

<div class="col-sm-4"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><a href="1_10_managing-sanctions-risk.html"><img class="kimgfilter3" src="data/files/managingsanctions.png"></a></span>
<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Managing Sanctions Risk has never been so complex. There are multiple sanctions bodies, each publish their own sanction list, which often do not align. The various sanction lists keeps growing and evolving daily. This makes it more difficult than ever for businesses to effectively identify and manage sanctions risk.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><a href="1_11_managing-bribery-corruption-risk..html"><img class="kimgfilter3" src="data/files/Courses/Managing Bribery &amp; Corruption Risk.png"></a></span>
<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">There is an increased regulatory focus on how firms obtain and retain business within emerging markets where bribery and corruption are present or in economies that are afflicted by high levels of corruption. It is imperative for organisations and their agents operating in these markets to know and understand the laws/legislations on bribery and corruption in order to deal effectively with bribery and corruption risk.</span></div>

<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Adequate customer information/data is the bed rock of a firm’s risk management and control for financial crime prevention. Performing effective Customer Due Diligence (CDD) on new and existing customers is key to understanding customers and the potential risks associated with the customers. Without proper CDD, banks are prone to reputational risk and significant fines.</span></div>

<div class="col-sm-4"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><a href="1_13_transaction-monitoring-effective....html"><img class="kimgfilter3" src="data/files/Courses/Transaction Monitoring &amp; Writing Effective Suspicious Activity Report.png"></a></span>
<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Financial crime is increasingly pervasive, to curb this, firms are obliged to identify, investigate and report any suspicious behaviour on ongoing basis at entity or transaction level. A study of firms’ TM outputs shows that, the quality of monitoring output generated from the incumbent generation of TM systems is usually poor resulting in low SAR filing rates.</span></div>
