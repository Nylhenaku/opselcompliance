<div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><i class="*">There is an increased regulatory focus on how firms obtain and retain business within emerging markets where bribery and corruption are present or in economies that are afflicted by high levels of corruption. It is imperative for organisations and their agents operating in these markets to know and understand the laws/legislations on bribery and corruption in order to deal effectively with bribery and corruption risk.</i></span></div></div><div data-pcid="1018" id="kpg_62823" class="kedit"><div class="keditable"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt; color: #332500;">Course Description &amp; Duration&nbsp;</span>
<div><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">This is a specialist course designed for managers, supervisors and employees within the financial sector subject to global and domestic Anti-Bribery and Corruption (AB&amp;C) laws and regulations. The course will help delegates to understand their roles and responsibilities in protecting their firm against bribery and corruption risk. Delegates will be equipped with knowledge and practical guidance on how to evaluate key vulnerable areas in the business such as dealing with PEPs, third parties and geographical/sectoral risk, hospitality, promotional and other business expenditures as well as the global and national anti- corruption frameworks and controls for delegate to understand the AB&amp;C regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Our approach in this in-depth course is to facilitate discussions on the laws/regulations that criminalise bribery and corruption while engaging in practical exercises based on true-life case studies on bribery and corruption. The interactive nature of the course brings the teaching materials to life and will enhance delegates’ ability to understand where they are most vulnerable in order to implement the appropriate procedures to manage AB&amp;C effectively.&nbsp;</span></div>
